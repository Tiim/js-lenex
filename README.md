# js-lenex

> LENEX 3.0 library for node.js and the browser.

This library helps reading LENEX 3.0 files. It currently provides a thin wrapper over the LENEX file format.
Generating lenex files is currently not supported, contributions are welcome.

Due to the library currently only being a thin wrapper, basic knowledge of the [LENEX format](https://wiki.swimrankings.net/index.php/swimrankings:Lenex) is required.
